## Notch Your Workflows Up

[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) sits as a small, movable notch on the right edge of your screen — always ready to run simple or complex tasks or automations whenever you need it.

**Sample queries:**

```text wrap
Email everyone in this sheet. Once the email is sent, mark the rows green and set a reminder to review this sheet with the team tomorrow.

@aithing Summarize all meetings and tasks for today.

Fix the issue in the selected text.

@aithing Highlight anything from my manager or related to invoices in my emails.

## Run Complex Tasks in Parallel

Run one-off tasks and **background automations** side by side. Get help right where you are, with whatever you need—**no need to copy and paste**. 

Handle multiple tasks in parallel, and enable AI agents to collaborate simultaneously.

<Card title="Available Agents" href="features/multiple-agents" icon="robot" arrow="true">
  Google Workspace Suite, Asana, Atlassian, Canva, GitHub, and many more... 
</Card>

## Privacy-First Approach

You control what the AI sees, starting with nothing by default. 

The simple assumption: **Everything on your screen is sensitive**, and anything outside your system is insecure.

No continuous capture — share only when you explicitly allow. No server storage — **all conversations, files, and keys stay local**.

We believe privacy is not a premium feature—it’s for everyone.

## Elevator Pitch

[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) is a privacy-first personal AI automation tool that runs entirely on your terms.

Use your own API keys, connect powerful agents like Google, GitHub, and Notion, and work with unlimited local files — all while keeping data stored only on your device.

Granular permissions ensure the AI gets just enough access to help, nothing more.
