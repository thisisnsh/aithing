### A Quick 2.0 Recap
[Version 2.0](/versions/2.0) was a major redesign focused on **simplicity**, **privacy**, and **autonomy**, introducing:

- **BYOK models** (Anthropic)
- **Custom MCP servers** (remote or local)
- **One-click agents**
- **Recurring automations**
- **Context without copy/paste**
- And much more…

Version 2.1 builds directly on that foundation.

---

### Open Source
AI Thing is now fully **open source**. Browse, audit, or contribute to the codebase: **https://github.com/aithing-lab/aithing-mac**

Open sourcing is a continuation of our commitment to privacy, transparency, and user ownership.

---

### Support for OpenAI and Gemini [BYOK Models](/features/byok-models)
Version 2.1 adds first-class support for:

- **OpenAI GPT-5 series**  
- **Google Gemini 3 and 2.5 series**  
- Existing **Claude 4.5** models  
- Plus any additional models you want to bring yourself

Choose the model that fits the task — and **use multiple models within a single conversation**.

---

### Notifications for [Automations](/features/automations)
Automations now send **native macOS notifications** when tasks start, run, or complete in the background.

No more checking or reopening a window — you’ll know exactly when something’s done.
