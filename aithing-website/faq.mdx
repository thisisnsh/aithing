Frequently asked questions about [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev)

<Tip>AI Thing is now fully [open source](https://github.com/aithing-lab/aithing-mac) — give the project a star to support!</Tip>

### 0. Why is this page named F*ck?  
Because when you're looking for answers, you just want the **f*cking answers** — fast, clear, no bullshit. So here they are.

### 1. Is this free?  
Yes — [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) does **not** charge for usage. All features, including agents and automations, are completely free.

We use BYOK — you buy credits from model providers for full control over costs.

### 2. Which models do you offer?  
We support all frontier models like **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI GPT-5**, and **Google Gemini 2.5 / 3**.  You can **use multiple of them in the same conversation**. See the full list here: [BYOK Models](/features/byok-models)

The open-source version lets you add your own models.

### 3. How do I get API keys?  
Each provider gives you an API key directly. Here are the links:

- [**Anthropic Claude**](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)  
- [**OpenAI GPT-5**](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
- [**Google Gemini**](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key)

Paste your key into **Settings → Models**, and you're ready to go.

### 4. Which agents do you have? Are they free? 

Yes — **all agents are free**. We offer many one-click [agents](/features/multiple-agents), including a complete Google Workspace agent *(Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Drive, and more)*, GitHub, Notion, Asana, Linear, and many others. 

If you need an agent we don’t have yet, email us at **help@aithing.dev**.

### 5. Can I add my own agent (MCP server)?  
Yes. You can add your own MCP server — remote (HTTP/SSE) or local (STDIO) — in seconds.  

Learn more: [Multiple Agents](/features/multiple-agents)

### 6. Do you sell data?  

Absolutely not. Read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). 

We only collect minimal account information (name and email), and you can **avoid sharing** even that by using the open-source version.

Nothing you send to the AI — conversations, files, context, or API keys — is ever stored on our servers.
