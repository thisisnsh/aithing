### [Secure Files](../features/v1/secure-files)

<Frame><img src="/images/v1/secure-files.png" /></Frame>

Work with multiple files and use them to ask questions or perform complex tasks with AI — **without uploading them to any server**.  

Files are encoded into a string and used only in the current tab. Once the tab is closed, the encoded strings are no longer available.  

This is a major feature for maintaining privacy.
