### Completely Free
All features — agents, automations, context tools, secure files, BYOK — remain free. 

[Privacy](privacy) is not a paid upgrade. It’s default.

---

### [Recurring Automations](/features/automations)
You can now schedule tasks to run automatically: daily summaries, weekly reviews, monthly cleanups, or one-off future actions.  

[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) handles the repetitive stuff — you stay focused on the important work.  

---

### [Native Screenshot Context](/features/selective-context)
Selective Context has been redesigned to use **macOS’ built-in screenshot shortcuts**.  

Any screenshot you take automatically appears in [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) — no dragging, clicking, or special tools.  

---

### [Selected Text From Any App](/features/selective-context)
You can now select text in **any application** and it automatically appears as context when [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) opens —  no copying and pasting required.  

---

### [Advanced Agents](/features/multiple-agents) 
Now includes a powerful set of one-click agents, including the industry’s most feature-complete **Google Workspace** agent, plus granular permissions for Google and GitHub.  

You can also add your own MCP servers in seconds (local or global).  

---

### [BYOK Models](/features/byok-models)
We removed managed/bundled models entirely.  

You now bring your own API key and choose whichever model you prefer.  

This gives you full control, lower costs, and complete data privacy.  

---

### Improved [Secure Files](/features/secure-files) UX
Files never touch our servers.  

They stay on your device and are only encoded temporarily for the model you choose.  

Unlimited files, multi-file reasoning, and true local privacy.  

---

### Improved [Local History](/features/local-history) UX
All conversations are stored locally on your system.  

No syncing, no cloud storage, no data collection — and you can continue or delete any conversation at any time.
