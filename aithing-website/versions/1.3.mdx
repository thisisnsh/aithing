### Privacy Upgrade – Selective Context Capture  
The previous version supported on-demand context capture.  
**Version 1.3 takes it further** with *granular* screen capture:  
- Drag to select a specific portion of the screen to use as context  
- Or click on any open application to capture just that application's content for context

### Crisp Boundaries & Drag Button  
Previous versions had uneven margins around [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev), which sometimes blocked clicks on applications behind it. That’s now fixed. 
*If you never noticed this before—you won’t now, which is good.* 

We’ve also added a **drag button** that appears when you hover over the top of [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev).

### Copy Button for Entire Output  
While you still can’t select the entire output as text (only paragraph-by-paragraph), you can now **copy the full output** in one click. The new **copy button** replaces the old help `(?)` icon in conversations.

### "Show on Screenshot" Option  
A new **Preferences** tab in Settings lets you toggle whether [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) appears in screenshots—perfect for sharing how beautiful this tool is.
