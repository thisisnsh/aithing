## Privacy-First by Design

[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) assumes **everything on your screen is sensitive**, and anything outside your system is treated as insecure.

We believe privacy is not a premium feature—it’s for everyone.

<Tip>AI Thing is now fully [open source](https://github.com/aithing-lab/aithing-mac) — give the project a star to support!</Tip>

### How Privacy Works in [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev)

- **No Continuous Capture**  
  Never records your screen or listens in the background.

- **Selective Context Only**  
  Context (like part of your screen or an open app) is only captured when you explicitly choose to.
  
- **Secure Access**   
  No API keys, tokens, or sensitive user information are stored on our servers; everything remains local to your system.

- **Transparency**  
  Before any file or text is sent to a model, you see exactly what will be shared in the preview.

- **Local History**  
  No conversation is stored on our servers. All conversations are stored locally on your system.

- **Secure Files**  
  Files are not persisted on our servers. They are encoded on your system and used only within your active tab.

- **Local Privacy Checks (Coming Soon)**  
  On-device models will scan shared content for sensitive data before it leaves your system.

### Data We Collect 

<Note>You can avoid providing any information by cloning the [open-source](https://github.com/aithing-lab/aithing-mac) repo and building your own version.</Note>

- **What We Collect:**  
  - Your name and email when you download and sign in (via Firebase Authentication).  
  - Three usage metrics: number of uses **with agents**, **without agents**, and **number of files** used in conversations.  

- **Why We Collect It:**  
  - Name and email: To identify users and provide account-related functionality.  
  - Usage metrics: To understand overall usage patterns and improve the product.  

- **What We Don’t Do**:  
  - We do **not** sell your data.  
  - We do **not** collect or store any **conversations, images, or API keys** that you use within [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev).  
  - We do **not** collect any usage data from outside [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev).

- **Where Your Data Lives**:  
  - All **configurations**, **API keys**, and **conversation history** are stored **locally on your system**, not on our servers. This ensures your sensitive data and personal conversations remain entirely under your control.  

### BYOK Models

<Note>AI may make mistakes — review carefully before performing irreversible actions.</Note>

Please review each provider’s privacy policy:

- **Anthropic** [Privacy Policy](https://privacy.anthropic.com)  

- **OpenAI** [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy)  

- **Google Gemini** [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en#privacy_notice)


### Managed Agents

- **Google Workspace**:
  - **Access**:
    - Access to your Google Account is managed through authentication tokens.
    - Tokens are stored only in memory within the [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) app and in temporary in-memory sessions on the server. They are never stored permanently.
    - Each time an action is performed, the token is transmitted from the app to the agent’s server using encryption.
  - **Retention**: 
    - We retain the tokens (that expire every hour) in memory only until they are needed to complete the requested action. 
    - No Google data is persisted on our servers or stored beyond the active session.
    - No user data or access credentials (tokens) are shared, transferred, or disclosed to third parties, or persisted anywhere.
    - With a strict one-hour expiration policy, access tokens expire and are refreshed only if the user uses the Google agent.
  - **Deletion**:
    - You can revoke [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev)’s access to your Google account at any time via [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com). 
    - Once revoked, [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) immediately loses access, and any in-memory tokens are permanently discarded.  
  - **Note**: AI can make mistakes. Perform irreversible actions carefully.

- **Others**: 
  - Refer to individual agent's privacy policies.

### MacOS Permissions

- **Finder Access**:  
  Used to retrieve screenshots taken by the user while **AI Thing** is open, enabling [selective context](features/selective-context#3-use-mac’s-native-screenshot-shortcuts).

- **Screen Capture Permission**:  
  Allows [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) to capture the screen when the user clicks the app’s context button, supporting [selective context](features/selective-context#1-use-context-from-any-application).

- **Accessibility Permission**:  
  Required to capture selected text when the user uses the *Text Selection* feature for [selective context](features/selective-context#2-use-“selected-text”-from-any-application).
