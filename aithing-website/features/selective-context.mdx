  Selective Context ensures [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) sees **only what you intentionally share** — nothing more.  
  There is no continuous capture, no background monitoring, and no automatic access to your apps.

## 1. Use Context From Any Application

With a single click, [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) instantly captures the relevant context from whatever app you’re using. 

Whether it’s text you’re highlighting, the window you’re viewing, or content you’re working on. 

<Tip>Enable **AI Thing** under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording.</Tip>

## 2. Use “Selected Text” From Any Application  

[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) can also take context from text you’ve selected anywhere on your system:

- In a browser  
- In a PDF  
- In a code editor  
- In email  
- In Slack  
- In any native macOS app  
- Or anywhere...

There is **no need to copy and paste** — the text remains local and ephemeral.

## 3. Use Mac’s Native Screenshot Shortcuts  

You capture your screen the same way you normally would on macOS:

- **Shift + Command + 3** → Full screen  
- **Shift + Command + 4** → Select an area  
- **Shift + Command + 4, then Space** → Capture a single window  

Whenever you take a screenshot using these native shortcuts, it instantly appears inside the [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) window — ready to be used as context.

You decide when and what to capture.

<Tip>Enable **AI Thing** under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Files & Folders.</Tip>

---

## Built for Privacy  
[AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) assumes **everything on your screen is sensitive**, so it only uses context you explicitly provide:

- No continuous capture  
- No background listening  
- No automatic access to windows  
- No syncing to servers  
- No storage of screenshots or selected text
