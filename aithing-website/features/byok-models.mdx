<Card title="" img="/images/byok-models.png">
  Connect to powerful large language models using **your own API keys** — giving you full control, privacy, and flexibility. AI Thing never sends data to any model provider unless *you* choose to connect your own key.
</Card>

<Tip>Now you can **use multiple models** in the same conversation.</Tip>

## BYOK: Bring Your Own Key

You choose the model. You bring the API key. **You stay in control.**  
AI Thing does **not** charge for usage — you pay only your provider, directly.

AI Thing now supports **Anthropic Claude**, **OpenAI GPT-5**, and **Google Gemini 2.5 / 3**, plus more coming soon.

## How to Connect

1. Get an API key from your chosen provider  
2. Paste the key into the corresponding field inside **Settings → Models**  
3. Select the default model you want AI Thing to use  

Keys usually look like:

- Anthropic: `sk-ant-...`  
- OpenAI: `sk-...`  
- Google: `AIza...`

Your keys are stored **locally on your device**, never uploaded anywhere.

## Add Your Own Models

The open-source version of AI Thing includes a `Models.plist` file inside the project.  
You can add custom models by editing this file:

- Add a **model ID**, **display name**, and **provider type**  
- Save the file and rebuild or relaunch  
- Your model will appear in **Settings → Models** and can be used immediately

This makes it easy to plug in local, experimental, or self-hosted models with minimal setup.

## Model Settings

Fine-tune how each model behaves in **Settings → Preferences**:

### Prompt Cache
Reuses common parts of a prompt to speed up responses and reduce cost during long or multi-turn conversations.  
Best used when you're working in the same thread for a while.

### Output Tokens
Set the maximum possible response length — helpful for keeping outputs concise or allowing long explanations.
