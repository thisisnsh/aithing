<Card title="" img="/images/secure-files.png">
  Secure Files lets you work with documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and more — without ever uploading anything to a server.  
  Everything happens **locally on your device**, giving you full privacy and control.
</Card>

- **Unlimited files** — add as many as you want.  
- **Multiple files** — ask the AI to analyze or reason across several files at once.  
- **Full privacy** — nothing leaves your system unless sent directly to your chosen BYOK model.

## How It Works

- Before being sent to an LLM, each file is **temporarily encoded** and included only in that single request.  
- [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) does **not** persist, store, log, or upload your files at any time.  
- When you close the chat, it becomes fully inaccessible.

This ensures you keep the same level of privacy you’d have working with files offline.

## Privacy

- [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) never receives your files. They are never stored on our servers — not even temporarily.
- Files remain on your device. The encoded representation is used only to talk to the model you selected.
- Because you use your own model provider, your files go **directly from your device to your chosen LLM**, never through [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev).
