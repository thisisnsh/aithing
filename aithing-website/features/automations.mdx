  Recurring Automations turn [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) into a personal operations layer for your day-to-day life — handling routine tasks automatically, on your schedule, using your own model and agents.
</Card>

## Create Automations

You can set up automations however you prefer — either **naturally, by writing what you want**, or **manually through settings**.

<Accordion title="Create Automations Using Natural Language" defaultOpen="true" >

  Just type a message anywhere you use AI Thing that starts with **@aithing**, followed by what you want it to do automatically.  

  Examples:

  ```text wrap
  @aithing Every morning at 9, summarize all my unread emails and highlight anything from my manager.

  @aithing At 5 p.m. daily, summarize all meetings on my calendar and list my action items.

  @aithing Every Monday at 8 a.m., check my Notion database and list overdue tasks.

  @aithing Tomorrow at 3 p.m., read the <sample> spreadsheet and draft a status update.

  @aithing At noon every day, search GitHub issues assigned to me and summarize anything new.
  ```

  This is the fastest and most natural way to create automations — just describe what you want done and when.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create Automations Manually (Settings → Automations)">

  If you prefer structure or want more control, you can also build automations manually.

  Each automation has four parts:

  * **Title** — A short, descriptive name
  * **Instruction** — What you want the AI to do
  * **Start Time** — When it should run
  * **Recurrence** — Daily, weekly, hourly, or a one-time future run

  Automations run **entirely in the background**, without needing to open AI Thing or repeat instructions.

</Accordion>

## Notifications

When an automation runs, you’ll receive a **native macOS notification** as soon as it completes.

This way you always know when:

* A summary or report is ready
* A scheduled reminder was sent
* A background workflow finished running
