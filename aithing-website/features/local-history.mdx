    Local History keeps your data **on your device**, giving you full control without sacrificing functionality.
</Card>

## How It Works
- All conversations are stored **locally on your system**, never on our servers.
- You can view your entire history at any time.
- Continue a past conversation seamlessly.
- Permanently delete any conversation with one click.

---

## Privacy First
- No conversations, screenshots, or files are ever uploaded or stored on [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) servers.
- Works perfectly with the **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** model — your API keys, your data, your device.

---

## Why It Matters
- Many platforms store your chats to train models or upsell premium tiers — [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) does neither.
- There is no cloud storage for conversations, no hidden “sync” features, and **we never sell your data**.
- Local History gives you the best balance of **privacy, continuity, and control**.
