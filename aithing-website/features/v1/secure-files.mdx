With Secure Files, you can add multiple files and use them to ask questions or perform complex tasks — all while keeping your data private.  

- **Unlimited files** — add as many files as you want, with no count restrictions.  
- **Multiple files** — query and reason across several files at once.  

## How It Works

- Files are **never uploaded to any server**.  
- Instead, they are **encoded into a string** and used only in the current browser tab.  
- Once the tab is closed, the encoded strings are no longer accessible.  

This ensures your files stay private while still letting AI process them effectively.

## Privacy

- **No persistence** — your files are never stored on our server. They are encoded as strings and sent directly to the LLM for processing.  
- **In-tab only** — everything happens securely within your current session. If you switch or close the tab, the files are no longer accessible.
