  Selective Context Capture gives you **full control** over what [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) can see.  

  By default, it starts in the most secure mode—**you choose exactly what to share**—ensuring no unnecessary data ever leaves your system.

### 1. **Drag to Select (Most Secure)**  

- Click and drag to select the exact portion of your screen you want to share.  
- Only that specific selection is sent to the AI model.  
- Perfect for sharing a small section of a spreadsheet, document, or browser page without exposing unrelated information.  

### 2. **Click on App to Capture**  

- Instead of dragging, simply click on any open application window.  
- [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) will use the content of that app as the context.  
- Ideal for when you need to work with the full content of an application but not your entire screen.

### 3. Entire Screen**  

- Capture everything on your screen as context.  
- Can be enabled in Settings from Preferences tab.

## Default Privacy Setting

By default, the **"Capture entire screen on @this"** toggle in Settings is **off**.  
This ensures the most secure, selective capture mode is always used unless you explicitly choose otherwise.

<Note>Nothing is captured continuously. Context is only taken when you explicitly use `@this` in your request.</Note>
