    Respond Anywhere moves us closer to a world where AI is not bound to applications, but available **everywhere you work**.
</Card>

This feature introduces two powerful keywords that let you interact with AI directly in your workflow.

## `@selected` 

Use `@selected` when you want AI to **grab a specific piece of text** that you’ve highlighted.

**How it works:**

```text
fix @this issue in the @selected text @here
````

Here:

* `@this` captures context from your request.
* `@selected` references the highlighted text.
* `@here` tells AI to rewrite the selected text in place — directly in your application.

## `@here`

Use `@here` when you want AI to **insert new content at your cursor** without replacing anything.

**How it works:**

```text
add new function to generate fibonacci numbers @here
```

The AI will generate a complete Fibonacci function and insert it at the cursor position.

## Why This Matters

This is more than just AI for specific apps — it’s **AI for all apps**.

With `@selected` and `@here`, you can seamlessly integrate AI into your existing workflows, whether you’re editing text, coding, drafting emails, or writing documents.
