  Connect to different large language models (brains) with your own API key—giving you full control over your AI capabilities.
</Card>

## Managed Models `BYOK`
Managed models allow you to select AI models based on your needs using your **API key**, such as:

- **Fast and cost-effective** (Claude Haiku 3.5)  
- **Balanced** (Claude Sonnet 4)  
- **High intelligence** (Claude Opus 4.1)  

To connect:
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/getting-started-with-the-api)  
2. Paste the key into the field that starts with `sk-ant-...`  

This option gives you **full ownership and flexibility**, with no [AI Thing](https://aithing.dev) plan required.  

## Model Settings 

In **Settings → Preferences**, you can fine-tune how models behave:

### Prompt Cache  
Reuses common parts of a prompt to speed up responses and lower costs during long or repetitive conversations. 
For one-time or short queries, caching may actually be more expensive — it’s most useful when a conversation is expected to continue over many turns.

### Output Tokens  
Set the maximum length of responses. Useful for keeping outputs concise or allowing longer, more detailed answers.
