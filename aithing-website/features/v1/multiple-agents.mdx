## Add Your Own Agents

Add your own agents **(MCP Servers)** manually, either **Global** agents (Remote HTTP MCP Servers), which are already hosted, or **Local** agents (Stdio MCP Servers), which run on your device.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Global Mode" icon="globe">

  <Card title="" img="/images/v1/multiple-agents-global.png">
    Use this when your agent is already hosted online (e.g. APIs, remote services).

    **Example:**

    ```text
      Name          GitHub
      URL           https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/
      Auth Token    ghp_*****  
    ````

    <Info>The Auth Token is optional. It is used to authenticate your access.</Info>
  </Card>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Local Mode" icon="server">

  <Card title="" img="/images/v1/multiple-agents-local.png">
    Use this when the agent runs locally on your own machine (e.g. through Docker, CLI tools, wrappers).

    **Example:**

    ```text
      Name        XCode
      Command     /usr/local/bin/xcode-npx-wrapper
      Arguments   -y xcodebuildmcp@latest
    ```
    
    <Info>Arguments are optional. These are space-separated values passed to the command.</Info>
  </Card>

  To add a new agent:

  1. Click **+ Add Agent**
  2. Enter the name, and choose between **Global** or **Local**
  3. Fill in the required fields based on the mode
  4. Toggle the agent ON to activate

  </Accordion>
