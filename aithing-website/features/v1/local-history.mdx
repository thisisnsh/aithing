    Local History is a step towards keeping your data **private and secure** while still enjoying full functionality.
</Card>

## How it Works
- All conversations are stored **locally on your system**.
- You can view your history at any time.
- Use the keyboard shortcut **Control + H** to quickly open or close the history panel.
- You can choose to **continue a past conversation** or **delete it** permanently.

## Privacy First
- No conversation is stored on our servers.
- This ensures your data stays with you, giving you full control over your information.
